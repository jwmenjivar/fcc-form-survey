This website is part of the freeCodeCamp's Responsive web design certification program. 

Web form skills will be put into practice and a codepen automated test will asses the final result giving a passing score.

So hope I do well. I must say that I hadn't realized that there's plenty of Markup Language Tags on forms.

Hope you enjoy watching how code improves as I go through.
